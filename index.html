              Mercury is the smallest planet, just a bit bigger than our Moon,
              and it’s the closest planet to the Sun.
            </li>
            <li>
              It has a rocky surface with many craters, similar to the Moon. No
              atmosphere means extreme temperature changes from day to night.
            </li>
            <li>
              Very hot during the day (up to 430°C or 800°F) and freezing at
              night (-180°C or -290°F).
            </li>
            <li>
              Mercury has no moons and takes just 88 Earth days to orbit the
              Sun.

              Thick clouds of sulfuric acid make Venus the hottest planet in the

              effect.
            </li>
            <li>
              The surface can reach up to 465°C (869°F), hotter than Mercury.

              Venus rotates in the opposite direction to most planets, so the
